This is an extremly dumb project inspired by videos like "An hour of silence occasionally broken up by x"

To use it:
- download the content of the output directory
- add mp3 files to the sfx directory inside
- and open the exe (if you want to modify the settings you will need to run it as administrator)

It's very rushed so quality is a no go but I tried making it as simple as possible while trying to be clear
as to what does what.
